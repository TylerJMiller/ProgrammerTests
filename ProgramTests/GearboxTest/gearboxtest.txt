Gearbox Programmer Exam.

Instructions:

Submissions are to be in plain text format. ie, no Word documents.

1. Rewrite the following function so that the following conditions are satisfied:

A) the multiplication operator ('*') is not used.

B) the division operator ('/') is not used.

C) the function does not make use of loops.

D) And no sneaky using assembly either!

int MultiplyBy123(int value)

{

int rslt;

rslt = value;

return rslt;

}

2. Write a function which takes an array of integers, and places all occurrences of

the value 0 (zero) to the back of the list. Non-zero values are to appear in the

same relative order.

example input:

2 0 2 3 4 64 98 0 2 0

example output:

2 2 3 4 64 98 2 0 0 0

Give one solution that emphasizes clarity.

Give another solution that emphasizes speed.

Solution should be in the form of C/C++ compilable source which demonstrates your 

solutions, using several test cases. You may only use standard C runtime library 

functions.  Use of STL, or other forms of templated containers, is not allowed.

We expect to be able to compile this submission and run as is. Please let us know 

the name and version of the compiler you use (we prefer solutions which compile 

in Visual Studio 2005, 2008, or 2010.)

3. Instruction set reference:

instruction:

mov mem[y], reg[x]

performs:

mem[y] <- reg[x]

copies value in register[x] to memory location[y]

NOTE: can only copy from register to memory

example:

mov mem1, reg1

instruction:

sub reg[x], mem[y]

performs:

reg[x] <- reg[x] - mem[y]

subtracts the number in memory location[y] from the number in register[x]

and stores the result in register[x]

example:

sub reg1, mem1

registers:

reg1

reg2

memory locations:

mem1

mem2

Given the above reference, use the mov and sub instructions to move a

value from mem1 to mem2.

4. Essay: Describe five important qualities of software.

5. Essay: Describe what you feel is the most important aspect of the software development process.

6. Is C++ slower than C? Why or why not?

7. Do you have any hobby software projects? If so, describe.

8. What achievement in software development are you most proud of?

9. In an object oriented fashion, design the classes and hierarchy for the backpack in a game that

can contain the following items: healing drink, combat knife, antidote shot, combat shield,

Beretta M92 (gun), Kevlar Vest. Include in the design the relationship between the classes, the hierarchy,

and any member variables and methods that you think each class should contain.

10. If you have not worked in the game development industry, why are you interested in a game development job?

If you have worked in game development, what do you most enjoy about it?
